### Hello, I'm Dawnbee ☀️🐝

I'm a developer-in-progress who enjoys designing systems and building them from the ground up.  
Currently, I'm diving deep into object-oriented design with Java — and expanding into web development to bring ideas to life in the browser.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java, Python, C++, Unity, Git, IntelliJ  
- React, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### 🧠 What I'm working on
- Building small full-stack apps to connect frontend & backend
- Learning how design patterns apply to both desktop and web
